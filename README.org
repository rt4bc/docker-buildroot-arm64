* Buildroot build out-of-tree
As default, everything built by Buildroot is stored in the directory output in the Buildroot tree.

Buildroot also supports building out of tree with a syntax similar to the Linux kernel. To use it, add O=<directory> to the make command line:
#+begin_src shell
 $ make O=/tmp/build
#+end_src
or:
#+begin_src shell
$ cd /tmp/build; make O=$PWD -C path/to/buildroot
#+end_src
